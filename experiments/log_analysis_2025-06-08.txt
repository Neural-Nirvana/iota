System Log Analysis â€“ Last 24 Hours

Summary of Findings
-------------------
After analyzing your macOS system logs from the last 24 hours (including system.log, install.log, and fsck_apfs_error.log):

- system.log: No errors, warnings, crashes, or panics. Only routine ASL (Apple System Logger) statistics and configuration notices were found.
- install.log: The most notable event was an installation of Oracle VirtualBox 7.1.10. There was a warning and a Python KeyError during the installation script, but the process completed successfully, and the application was installed.
- fsck_apfs_error.log: Shows a filesystem check (fsck_apfs) ran and completed with no detected errors.
- system.log.0.gz: Not present or not accessible, but the primary system.log contained ample recent entries.

Notable Events
--------------
- VirtualBox Install:
  - A Python script during installation reported a KeyError: 'install', but the rest of the log shows the installation and post-install checks completed, and no system instability was reported.
- No Critical Issues:
  - No system crashes, kernel panics, persistent warnings, or unresolved failures were logged.

Conclusion
----------
No urgent or critical issues detected in the last 24 hours. Your system appears healthy based on the available logs.
